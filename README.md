# FlightSurety

FlightSurety is a sample application project for Udacity's Blockchain course.
The workflow is as follows:
1. **Register an Airline**, with a name and an ETH Address
2. **Pay 10 ETH Fee** for getting full membership
3. **Register a Flight** (only full-members), with Flight code, origin and destiny
4. **Buy an Insurance** for that Flight
5. **Claim Repayment**, if the conditions are met (flight delayed due to Airline fault) - this is checked via the Oracle server
